<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, President Donald Trump has touted unproven remedies, both before and after he was diagnosed with the disease. His rhetoric sends the message to Americans that we donâ€™t need to wait for clinical evidence before declaring that something works and waiting for evidence would unjustly deprive people of access to cures. In this framework, a single positive response to a new treatment is the same as a <em>cure,</em> and making unproven treatments available to everyone is the same as <em>equality.</em></p>
