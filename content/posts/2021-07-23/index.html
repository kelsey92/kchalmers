<blockquote>
<p>Importance: There has been insufficient research on the patient harms and costs associated with potential low-value procedures in the US Medicare population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Objective: To report the prevalence of adverse events associated with potential low-value procedures and the additional hospital length of stay (LOS) and costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study using Medicare fee-for-service claims between January 2016 to December 2018. Participants were aged 65 years or older. Procedures were selected if they had previously published indicators of low-value care, including knee arthroscopy, spinal fusion, vertebroplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), carotid endarterectomy, renal stenting, and hysterectomy for benign conditions. Analysis was conducted from July to December, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Outcomes and Measures: For inpatient procedures, the number and rate of admissions with a hospital-acquired condition (HAC) or patient safety indicator event (PSIs), as well as the unadjusted and adjusted difference in mean LOS and Medicare costs between admissions with and without a HAC/PSI. For outpatient procedures, we report the number of claims where the beneficiary had an unplanned hospital admission within seven days and the number of these admissions with a HAC/PSI.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Results: There were 573,351 patients included in the study, with 617,264 procedures; the mean (SD) age was 74.2 (6.7) years, with 320,637 women (55.9%), and mostly White patients (520,735; 90.8%). Among the 197,755 claims for the inpatient procedures, 231 had an HAC and 1764 had a PSI. Spinal fusion was associated with the most HACs (123 admissions) and PSIs (1015 admissions). Overall, HACs during a PCI admission were associated with the highest adjusted additional mean LOS (17.5 days; 95% CI, 10.3-23.6), with also the highest adjusted additional mean cost ($22,000; 95% CI, $9100-$32,600). There were 419,509 included outpatient procedures, and 7514 (1.8%) had an unplanned admission within 7 days. A total of 17 HACs and PSIs occurred in these admissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional cohort study of Medicare fee-for-service claims, patients receiving potential low-value care were exposed to risk of unnecessary harm associated with higher cost and LOS.</p>
